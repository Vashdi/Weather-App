# Weather App

A simple WEATHER APP that displays the average temperature for each day of the week over the next two weeks.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vashdi/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

3. To avoid CORS origin policy issues I downloaded Live Server extension and run index.html using Live server. 
   (it shouldn't be needed when you test on browser)

4. Enter a city name or coordinates in the input field and click "Search".

5. The average temperatures for the next two weeks will be displayed.

## API Key

This weather app uses the Weatherapi API.
You need to sign up and get an API key from Weatherapi (https://www.weatherapi.com).

Replace `API_KEY` in the `index.js` file with your API key.
